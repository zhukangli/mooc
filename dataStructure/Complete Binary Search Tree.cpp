/**
04-树6 Complete Binary Search Tree（30 分）
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
A Complete Binary Tree (CBT) is a tree that is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right.

Now given a sequence of distinct non-negative integer keys, a unique BST can be constructed if it is required that the tree must also be a CBT. 
You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of this BST.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (≤1000). Then N distinct non-negative integer keys are given in the next line. 
All the numbers in a line are separated by a space and are no greater than 2000.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding complete binary search tree.
 All the numbers in a line must be separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

Sample Input:

10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
Sample Output:

6 3 8 1 5 7 9 0 2 4

解读一下：
完全二叉搜索树的层次遍历 
满二叉树： 所有层的节点数都达到最大
完全二叉树：除最后一层可能不满以外，其他各层都达到该层节点的最大数，最后一层如果不满，该层所有节点都全部靠左排
完全二叉搜索树： 就是完全二叉树 + 搜索树
